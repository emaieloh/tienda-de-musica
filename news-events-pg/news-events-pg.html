        <h1>Read Jim James’ ‘American Beauty’ Tribute From New Grateful Dead Vinyl Boxset</h1>

            <p>My Morning Jacket’s Jim James praises American Beauty, his “gateway” into the world of the Grateful Dead, in this exclusive excerpt from Vinyl Me Please’s The Story of The Grateful Dead, a 14-LP box set culled from the legendary jam band’s career.</p>
            <p>The Story of The Grateful Dead, the latest installment in the VMP Anthology series, contains eight classic Dead albums — Workingman’s Dead, American Beauty, Live/Dead, Europe ’72, Terrapin Station, Reckoning, Without a Net and Wake of the Flood — each remastered from the original tapes and pressed onto an assortment of 180-gram colored vinyl.</p>
            <p>Each album in the VMP Anthology set is also accompanied by liner notes featuring an artist paying tribute to that Dead LP, including Animal Collective’s Avey Tare on Live/Dead, Dirty Projectors’ Dave Longstreth on Workingman’s Dead, Margo Price on Wake of the Flood and more. Members of the National, the Decemberists, STS9, Hiss Golden Messenger and more also pen odes to their respective Dead favorites.</p>
            <p>In his liner notes for American Beauty, James writes that even though he was exposed to the Dead at a young age the band didn’t connect with him… until he purchased his own copy of the 1970 LP during a My Morning Jacket tour.</p>
            <p>“I listened to the album two or three times that night just taking it in, living in its world and loving it, trying to understand what this feeling was,” James writes. “It wasn’t happy, nor was it sad. Yet, it reflected the presence and possibility of every emotion in the rainbow, and the recording was unbelievable. The talent and musicianship were undeniable. The lyrics melted my mind.”</p>
            <p>James continues, “And then one day it hit me: When someone hears the Grateful Dead, in whatever state or form it may hit you in — and there are many — they feel the way they WANT to feel.”</p>
            <p>The Story of the Grateful Dead follows VMP Anthology collections dedicated to Stax Records, the women of Motown, Ghostly International and more. The set is available to order now through Vinyl Me Please.</p>

        <h1>Sammy Hagar on Life in Quarantine: ‘I’m Enjoying Doing Nothing’</h1>
        <div class="article-container clearfix">
            <div class="img-container float-left">
                <img src="../images/news-events2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Sammy Hagar thought he’d be spending the summer playing outdoor amphitheaters with his band the Circle alongside Whitesnake and Night Ranger. And even though those dates haven’t technically been canceled yet, he knows it would take a small miracle for the tour to go on as planned. He’s kept busy by teaming up with his Circle bandmates remotely to cover songs like the Who’s “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” Bob Marley’s “Three Little Birds,” and Van Halen’s “Good Enough.” But mainly he’s just cooking, sleeping, walking on the beach, watching Ozark on Netflix, and waiting for life to return to normal. He took a break from all that to phone up Rolling Stone and chat about his lockdown life.</p>
            <p><strong>How are you doing?</strong><br>
            I’m actually doing fine. I feel sorry for the world and all the people out of work and I feel terrible for all that kind of stuff. But other than that, I’m enjoying doing nothing for the first time in my life.</p>
            <p><strong>Walk me through your average day of doing nothing.</strong><br>
            When I wake up, I don’t have to get out of bed because I don’t have anything to do. It’s not like, “Hey, you’ve got an interview at 9:30” or “You gotta be somewhere,” so I just stay in bed until I feel like getting up. I look at my morning e-mails and texts because I don’t work after 7 p.m. I just shut everything down after that. I just lay in bed and do all that, naked.</p>
            <p>My wife opens the blinds up and the doors and the windows. I just lay there sometimes until as late as 10:30 or 11:00. I roll out, but don’t get dressed. I mean, I put on a bathing suit. I live in California, so it’s warm. I brush my teeth and scratch my hand through my hair to fluff it up a little to get rid of bedhead and I come downstairs and have a little breakfast and coffee, maybe make a few phone calls.</p>
            <p>I pick up my guitar and noodle around. At 1:30 or 2:00 I go for a walk on the beach and then have a quick little lunch. I’m not a big breakfast guy. I have a light breakfast. I come back and my wife and I will go for another walk or I’ll take a nap. Maybe I’ll fire up the jacuzzi for later.</p>
            <p>I have started to move my cocktail hour up to 4:30 now. I’ll mix myself a nice margarita or a mojito, my two favorite cocktails, and start thinking about dinner. I go through the refrigerator and go, “What do you feel like?” I start prepping and eat dinner around 6:00 with a nice bottle of wine. Around 8:00 I jump in the jacuzzi. And maybe watch a movie around 9:00 and then go to bed [laughs]. I’m dead serious. Kind of sad, huh?</p>
