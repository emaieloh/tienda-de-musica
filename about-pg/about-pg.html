        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Established in 1994, Tienda de Musica Instruments Inc. was primarily created with the simple objective of fulfilling the need of the local guitar industry in Northern Luzon and Visayas Regions for guitar parts and accessories. However, the growing popularity and rampant development of music generated a demand for alternative sources for musical instrument procurement. Instrument players and music enthusiasts were in search of an outlet that is both credible and reliable. Tienda de Musica responded by opting to expand its product line to a complete selection of musical instruments. Subsequently, Tienda de Musica was able to contribute assistance and become an instrument in the widespread love and celebration of music.</p>
        <p>In its 26 years of service, Tienda de Musica has always been a customer-focused organization, maintaining its core value of prioritizing customer satisfaction over revenue. Tienda de Musica holds great value in constituting friendly and loyal relationships through proper assistance and participation in determining whatâ€™s best for the customer.</p>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to maximize and nourish the potential benefits arising from the love of music. With this in mind, the goal is to further develop our range and scope through establishing additional branches and distributors. Beyond that, Tienda de Musica aims to equip musicians with the best available products by constantly updating and providing access to new and innovative products.</p>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Since opening its doors to the Philippine market, Tienda de Musica, along with its customer-friendly staff, has always envisioned itself as a devoted supporter of the local music industry and a leading provider of high quality and affordable musical instruments and accessories with an ample array of brands for music lovers in all places.</p>
